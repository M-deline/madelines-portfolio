## What is this project?
- This project is to help solidify understanding of basic CSS structure to help stylize a website. With this challenge I started from scratch and created an HTML file and then linked a CSS file to the HTML file. I stylized the content of the website by using classes, ids, and root selectors. This project helped me practice changing the margin, padding, and border settings and helped me understand what each of those are and what they do. I also learned about colors and how to change the font and font color as well as how to make a gradient.
