## Overview and Description
- This project is to help solidify understanding of basic CSS structure to help stylize a website. With this challenge I started from scratch and created an HTML file and then linked a CSS file to the HTML file. I stylized the content of the website by using classes, ids, and root selectors. This project helped me practice changing the margin, padding, and border settings and helped me understand what each of those are and what they do. I also learned about colors and how to change the font and font color as well as how to make a gradient. 
- This challenge made me motivated to gain a better understanding of CSS and learn how it is used outside of the class. I was motivated to learn how to structure and stylize the different lists such as the nav bar and understand the work that is done, such as making it move to the side and have the text decoration (or not having text-decoration). The most important part of this project is that it is functional and that the basic CSS elements are there and in use to make sure the code makes sense and it written in the clearest way possible so that it is easy for the developer/person writing the code and for anyone that comes along to change or review the code in the future. 
- I struggled with the images the most and making sure that the images would change based on the different screens for different devices and still make sure the website ran well. I hope to improve this by practicing more with CSS and using screen media and elements in my free time to make sure that I understand how and why they work the way they do.
